- Use secure tools from `secure_network_tools.py` for all OS commands.
- Ensure all new API endpoints require an API key for access.
- Validate and sanitize all inputs received from API requests.
- Never use `shell=True` in any subprocess calls.
- Write all database queries using parameterized statements.
- Keep all attack functionality as educational simulations.
- Log all errors and security-relevant events to `cyber_matrix.log`.
- Add rate limiting to any new computationally expensive endpoint.
- Define dependencies with specific versions in `requirements.txt`.
- Keep the default network binding to `127.0.0.1` for security.
