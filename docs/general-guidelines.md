# General Guidelines

## Overview
Use this file when no specific markdown file exists for a task. These are the fallback guidelines that apply to all areas of the CYBER-MATRIX v8.0 project when module-specific documentation is not available.

---

## üéØ Core Principles

### 1. Security First
- **Never** introduce code that could create security vulnerabilities
- Always validate and sanitize user inputs
- Never use `shell=True` in subprocess calls
- Use parameterized queries for all database operations
- Follow the principle of least privilege

### 2. Documentation Driven
- Never make arbitrary changes without a documented basis
- If unsure about a change, halt and reference `docs/project-rules.md`
- Document any new addition with a markdown file before coding
- Keep documentation synchronized with code changes
- All new features must be documented before implementation

### 3. Code Quality Standards
- Follow best practices in security, architecture, and consistency
- Write clean, readable, and maintainable code
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Follow PEP 8 style guide for Python code
- Maintain consistent code formatting throughout the project

### 4. Architecture Consistency
- Respect directory structure and naming conventions at all times
- Keep backend and frontend strictly separated
- Use established patterns for similar functionality
- Don't introduce new dependencies without justification
- Follow the existing project structure

---

## üîß Development Guidelines

### Code Structure
- **Maintain clear function boundaries**: Each function should do one thing well
- **Avoid code duplication**: Extract common functionality into reusable functions
- **Use appropriate abstractions**: Don't over-engineer, but don't under-engineer either
- **Follow SOLID principles**: Single responsibility, Open/closed, Liskov substitution, Interface segregation, Dependency inversion

### Naming Conventions
- **Files**: Use snake_case for Python files (e.g., `network_tools.py`)
- **Functions**: Use snake_case for function names (e.g., `scan_network()`)
- **Classes**: Use PascalCase for class names (e.g., `NetworkScanner`)
- **Constants**: Use UPPER_CASE for constants (e.g., `DEFAULT_PORT`)
- **Variables**: Use snake_case for variables (e.g., `target_ip`)

### Error Handling
- Always handle potential errors gracefully
- Provide meaningful error messages
- Log errors appropriately
- Never expose sensitive information in error messages
- Return appropriate HTTP status codes for API endpoints

### Testing
- Write tests for all new functionality
- Ensure tests pass before committing changes
- Maintain test coverage above 80%
- Test both success and failure cases
- Include edge case testing

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Guidelines

### Input Validation
- Validate all user inputs before processing
- Use whitelist validation when possible
- Sanitize inputs to prevent injection attacks
- Validate data types, ranges, and formats
- Never trust client-side validation alone

### Authentication & Authorization
- Require API keys for all sensitive endpoints
- Validate API keys on every protected request
- Use environment variables for secrets
- Never hardcode credentials
- Implement rate limiting on sensitive endpoints

### Data Protection
- Never log sensitive information
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest
- Use secure communication protocols
- Follow data minimization principles
- Implement proper access controls

### Dependency Management
- Keep all dependencies up to date
- Pin dependency versions in `requirements.txt`
- Regularly scan for vulnerabilities
- Remove unused dependencies
- Review dependency security advisories

---

## üìù Documentation Standards

### Code Documentation
- Add docstrings to all functions and classes
- Document parameters, return values, and exceptions
- Include usage examples for complex functions
- Keep comments up to date with code changes
- Use clear and concise language

### Markdown Documentation
- Use proper markdown formatting
- Include table of contents for long documents
- Add code examples where appropriate
- Keep documentation concise and scannable
- Update documentation when code changes

### API Documentation
- Document all endpoints with their parameters
- Include request and response examples
- Specify required headers and authentication
- Document error responses
- Keep API docs synchronized with implementation

---

## üîÑ Version Control

### Git Practices
- Write clear, descriptive commit messages
- Make atomic commits (one logical change per commit)
- Use feature branches for new development
- Keep commits focused and small
- Don't commit generated files or build artifacts

### Commit Messages
- Use present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Capitalize the first letter
- Keep the first line under 50 characters
- Provide detailed description in the body if needed
- Reference issue numbers when applicable

### Branch Management
- Use descriptive branch names
- Delete branches after merging
- Keep branches up to date with main
- Resolve conflicts carefully
- Review changes before merging

---

## üß™ Quality Assurance

### Before Committing
- ‚úÖ Run all tests and ensure they pass
- ‚úÖ Check for linting errors
- ‚úÖ Verify code follows project conventions
- ‚úÖ Update documentation if needed
- ‚úÖ Review changes yourself before pushing

### Code Review Checklist
- Does the code follow project standards?
- Are there any security vulnerabilities?
- Is the code well-documented?
- Are there adequate tests?
- Is the code maintainable?

### Performance Considerations
- Avoid unnecessary database queries
- Cache data when appropriate
- Use efficient algorithms and data structures
- Profile code for performance bottlenecks
- Optimize only when necessary (avoid premature optimization)

---

## üé® User Experience

### Frontend Development
- Maintain consistency with existing UI/UX
- Ensure responsive design for all screen sizes
- Provide clear feedback for user actions
- Handle loading states appropriately
- Make error messages user-friendly

### API Design
- Follow RESTful conventions
- Use appropriate HTTP methods
- Return consistent response formats
- Include proper status codes
- Version APIs when making breaking changes

### Accessibility
- Follow WCAG guidelines
- Ensure keyboard navigation works
- Use semantic HTML
- Provide alt text for images
- Test with screen readers

## üö® When in Doubt

If you encounter a situation not covered by this document:

1. **STOP** - Don't proceed without proper guidance
2. **Reference** `docs/project-rules.md` for higher-level guidance
3. **Search** for similar patterns in the existing codebase
4. **Consult** module-specific documentation if applicable
5. **Ask** for clarification if still uncertain

---

## üìã Quick Decision Tree

```
Is there a module-specific doc for this task?
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ YES ‚Üí Use module-specific doc
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ NO  ‚Üí Continue to next question

Does project-rules.md cover this?
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ YES ‚Üí Follow project-rules.md
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ NO  ‚Üí Continue to next question

Is this covered in general-guidelines.md?
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ YES ‚Üí Follow these guidelines
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ NO  ‚Üí HALT and ask for guidance
```

---

## ‚öñÔ∏è Priority of Guidelines

When guidelines conflict or overlap:

1. **Security always wins** - Security requirements override everything
2. **Project-rules.md** - Global rules take precedence
3. **Module-specific rules** - Specific rules override general ones
4. **General-guidelines.md** - This document is the fallback
5. **Common sense** - Use good judgment when rules don't cover a case

---

## üîÑ Maintaining These Guidelines

### When to Update
- New patterns emerge in the codebase
- Security best practices evolve
- Project requirements change
- Common issues are discovered
- Team processes improve

### How to Update
- Propose changes through pull requests
- Get team review and approval
- Update related documentation
- Announce changes to the team
- Archive old versions if needed

---

*Remember: These guidelines exist to maintain quality, security, and consistency. When in doubt, err on the side of caution and ask for guidance.*
