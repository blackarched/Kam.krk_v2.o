- Ensure every interactive element is connected to a live API endpoint.
- Replace all mock or static data with live data from the backend.
- Handle all API call failures gracefully without crashing the UI.
- Sanitize any data displayed in the UI that originates from the backend.
- Provide clear visual feedback for all user actions and operations.
- Send the API key with every request to a protected endpoint.
- Keep the user interface responsive and functional on different screen sizes.
- Do not expose raw error messages from the backend directly to the user.
