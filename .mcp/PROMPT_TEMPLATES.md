## üí° Tips for Using Templates

### Customization

1. Replace `[PLACEHOLDERS]` with your specific values
2. Add/remove MCP operations based on your needs
3. Adjust requirements to match your specific case
4. Combine multiple templates for complex tasks

### Best Practices

1. **Always start with documentation reads** - Use filesystem MCP to understand context
2. **Use sequential-thinking for complex tasks** - Plan before implementing
3. **Use memory for cross-session consistency** - Remember decisions and patterns
4. **Verify with git diff** - Review all changes before committing
5. **Run tests after changes** - python3 test_security.py

### Chaining Templates

You can chain templates together for complex workflows:

```
1. Use Template 20 (Explain Architecture) to understand project
2. Use Template 1 (Start New Feature) to plan implementation
3. Use Template 13 (Add Tests) to ensure quality
4. Use Template 4 (Pre-Commit Check) to verify security
5. Use Template 6 (Deployment Review) before releasing
```

---

## üöÄ Next Steps

After using these templates:

1. **Customize for your needs** - Save frequently used variants
2. **Share with team** - Create team-specific templates
3. **Update regularly** - Add new templates as patterns emerge
4. **Contribute back** - Submit useful templates to the project

---

**These templates are designed to maximize the value of MCP servers.**

**Use them to accelerate development while maintaining security and quality.**

**Customize freely, but always prioritize security and follow project rules.**
